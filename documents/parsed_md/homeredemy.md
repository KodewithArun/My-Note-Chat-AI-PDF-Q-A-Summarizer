# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Foreword

Traditional systems of medicines, including herbal medicines, have been used for many centuries for health care by people in countries of the South-East Asia Region as well as in other parts of the world. Traditional medicine continues to be a valuable source of remedies that have been used by millions of people around the world to secure their health. It has been developed from empirical experiences and from observations made by people who use them. It embodies age-old wisdom and knowledge accrued over thousands of years, and forms an integral part of the social and cultural heritage of peoples and countries. The system has been inherited and handed down from one generation to the next by custom and tradition.

Since the concept of “Health for All” through primary health care (PHC) was launched at the International Conference on Primary Health Care at Alma-Ata in 1978, there has been a global movement to realize universal health-care coverage. However, in spite of advances made in the health sector, equitable health care coverage; availability, accessibility and affordability to conventional health care and services are quite often beyond the reach of people who are indigent, marginalized and underserved. Moreover, the present upsurge in the use of traditional medicines or complementary and alternative medicine – generated after the Alma-Ata International Conference – has become a global phenomenon. This development portends well for a more comprehensive health care delivery and health sector reform in facing new challenges in PHC due to demographic, economic, environmental, and social changes that have a negative impact on health development.



# The Revitalization of Primary Health Care

The revitalization of primary health care in 2008 was yet another clarion call for governments, all health and development workers, and the world community to protect and promote the health of all people. In these efforts, the rich resources of traditional and herbal remedies are available and accessible to all who choose to use them – by tradition or cultural acceptance in the far and remote corners of countries or by choice of those in the affluent urban communities where there is a desire to return to nature and to use natural remedies in taking care of their own health.

## Global Health Challenges

The global health scenario is facing new challenges due to global warming and economic downturn that are now threatening health development. It is therefore crucial that all systems of medicine – whether conventional or traditional – in so far as they are beneficial and not deleterious to the health and well-being of the people must play their respective roles in promoting health, in preventing disease, in curing the sick, and in rehabilitating the infirm. It is through these concerted efforts that tangible gains can be achieved.

## Publication Goals

It is envisaged that this publication will be instrumental in:
- Revitalizing primary health care
- Empowering community participation in self-care
- Promoting the application of appropriate technology that is socially and culturally acceptable to the people
- Making the health system more people-centered
- Improving equitable access to national health systems

# Amalaki Powder for Acidity and Gastritis

Heartburn is due to excessive secretion of gastric acid or its reflux to the food pipe along with delayed gastric emptying and fermentation of food. Gastric acidity and inflammation of the stomach is called gastritis, which produces a common symptom of burning sensation in the middle part of the upper half of the abdomen, while acid reflux causes throat and heartburn. Delayed gastric emptying with fermentation leads to gaseous distension of the abdomen and belching. These abnormalities lead to symptoms like nausea, loss of appetite, indigestion, and mild to moderate upper abdominal pain and distress.

Frequent dietary irregularities and ingestion of irritant materials like too spicy and sour foods, alcohol, and analgesic drugs like aspirin are the common causes of acidity and gastritis. Mental stress significantly aggravates the symptoms of acidity and gastritis.

Ayurveda designates the symptom complex of acid peptic disease as Amlapitta, attributed to the impairment of digestive juices and protective lining of the stomach. Improperly treated acidity may lead to peptic ulcer due to damage in the mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. Judicious use of Amalaki powder is effective in the successful management of acidity and gastritis with certain do’s and don’ts described in the Ayurvedic texts:

1. It is advisable not to overeat and have long gaps between meals. Small frequent meals of soft and easily digestible food items should be taken.
2. Consumption of raw and leafy vegetables, fried, spicy, sour, salty, heavy, and improperly cooked food, sheep’s milk, alcohol, curd, and sesame seeds should be avoided.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Use of Vegetables in Acidity and Gastritis

1. Use of vegetables with bitter taste such as bitter gourd, banana flowers, and pumpkin, pomegranate, honey, boiled and cooled water, and food grains like wheat, rice, and barley is beneficial in patients with acidity and gastritis.
2. Suppression of natural urges, particularly of vomiting and passing stools, should be avoided.

## Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica Linn.)

The formulation is made from the dried mature fruits of Amalaki, which is a small or medium-sized tree found abundantly in mixed deciduous forests and cultivated in gardens and home yards. Ripe fruits are collected in late winter or early summer and are dried in shade. Dried fruits are then separated from the seeds and are kept in airtight plastic bags or boxes under dry storage conditions. Extensive uses of Amalaki as medicine and tonic are described in Indian Medicine, and the medicinal plant is included in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.

### Composition

The formulation is a fine powder made of a single herbal ingredient, Amalaki.

# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. **General Safety**
Amalaki powder is generally a safe medicine. No toxic or adverse effects are reported even with continuous use. Assay studies for cellular toxicity of crude alcoholic extract of Amalaki have proved it safe. The safety of *Emblica officinalis* is attributed to its anti-mutagenic, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-tumour, and immuno-modulatory activities, along with numerous indications for its use in children and pregnant women. It is also safe for the baby if the nursing mother is taking this medication.

2. **Sensitivity to Sour Taste**
Individuals sensitive to sour taste should add sugar to the formulation or consume it in capsule form. Mixing it in warm water or with sugar or honey makes ingestion of Amalaki powder easier.

3. **Cooling Property**
Amalaki has a cooling property; hence, individuals intolerant to cold should consume it with ginger powder and warm water or honey. If symptoms worsen, medication with Amalaki powder may be stopped.

4. **Dietary Recommendations**
It is advisable for patients with acidity and gastritis to avoid the intake of spicy, hard, heavy, dry, and raw foods, particularly leafy vegetables and salad. The tendency to overeat, frequent munching, and the use of alcoholic beverages should be avoided.

# Trikatu Powder for Common Cold

Common cold or coryza is a common respiratory problem caused by a variety of viral infections; the most common among them is the influenza virus and its variants. Individuals show considerable variation in susceptibility, and environmental exposure is a contributory factor.

The word “cold” is a catch-all term that describes symptoms such as sneezing, wet nose, running nose, scratchy throat, heaviness in head, body ache, headache, indigestion, nausea, stomach ache, vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever.

Frequent attacks of cold are a reflection of a temporary dip in immunity that is most often caused by insufficient rest. Too many rich foods, stress, and exposure to cold and dampness can also precipitate its occurrence. Frequent colds can make the individual vulnerable to secondary lower respiratory tract infections. Early and consistent attention, along with adequate time for convalescence, keeps all colds from becoming problematic.

## Management with Trikatu

Trikatu is a simple herbal preparation with which common cold can be managed successfully by taking prescribed precautions:

1. Patients suffering from common cold should prevent direct exposure to cold wind, intake of heavy meals, drinking of cold water, suppression of natural urges of stools, urine, and flatus, sleeping on the floor, and during daytime.
2. Light meals with spicy, sour, and salty taste, curd, garlic, frequent drinking of warm water, fresh radish, brinjal (eggplant), and hot soup of green gram are helpful in common cold.
3. Covering the head with a cap or any warm cloth, steam bath, head massage, gargles with warm water, and avoidance of anger facilitate recovery from the common cold.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Trikatu Powder

Trikatu powder is a simple formulation made by mixing fine powders of three commonly used herbal drugs in equal quantity, namely dry ginger (Shunthi), black pepper (Maricha), and long pepper (Pippali). Trikatu literally means ‘three pungents,’ because all three ingredients are predominantly of pungent taste. All three are spices used commonly in the kitchen and traded widely from India since ancient times.

## Composition

Trikatu powder consists of fine powder of three pungent drugs viz. Shunthi, Maricha, and Pippali in equal proportion.

- **Shunthi** is the dried rhizome of ginger.
- **Maricha** is the dried fruit of black pepper.
- **Pippali** is the dried fruit of long pepper.

| Maricha⁵    | Not more than 6% | Not more than 1% | - | - | Not more than 2% |
| Pippali⁶    | Not more than 5% | Not more than 6% | Not less than 12% | Not less than 11% | Not more than 2% |

## Method of Preparation

1. Take 50 grams of each of the three ingredients, dry them further to remove the moisture for easy powdering.
2. Take an equal quantity of each drug of Trikatu and mix well in a dry container.
3. Grind the mixture in a grinder or pulverizer till fine powder is obtained.
4. Sieve the powder through 85 size mesh to remove the coarse fibers and other particles if any.
5. Keep Trikatu powder in an air-tight dry container of glass or food-grade plastic; store in a dry cool place away from direct sunlight. It is good to use the powder within one year.

## Dosage Form

Blackish-brown fine powder.

# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Indications and Uses

Trikatu is used in combination with honey to alleviate diseases such as colds, rhinitis, cough, breathlessness, asthma, dyspepsia, and obesity. It also improves digestive power.

# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. No side effect or toxic effect of Trikatu has been mentioned in the classical literature. Clinical studies have also shown no adverse effects in patients treated with the recommended dose of Trikatu powder alone as well as in combination with other herbal preparations.

2. Since Trikatu powder is hot in nature, large doses should be avoided as the patient may complain of burning sensation, burning micturition, etc. In such conditions, the use should be stopped immediately, and the patient should be advised to take cooling agents and milk in plenty until the complaints subside completely.

3. Take a simple diet with warm, light, soft, and liquid foods. Avoid cold drinks, cold juices, ice cream, spicy, oily, and too dry foodstuff. Stay in a warm and well-ventilated room.

4. Warm saline gargles, steam inhalation, and fomentation help in relieving cold symptoms.

5. Medication with Trikatu is not advisable for pregnant women. However, it is safe for the baby if a nursing mother is taking this medication.

# Daruharidra Decoction for Conjunctivitis

Inflammation of conjunctiva causing redness of the eye is conjunctivitis. Conjunctiva is a thin, transparent mucous membrane covering the under surface of the eye lids and it extends from the eye lids to cover the anterior part of the eyeball up to the margin of the cornea.

## Symptoms of Conjunctivitis

Common symptoms of conjunctivitis are:
- Redness
- Itching
- Stickiness
- Foreign body sensation
- Irritation
- Watering from the eyes
- Sometimes intolerance to light

Vision is generally normal but a slight blurring may occur if excess secretions form a film over the cornea. Conjunctivitis may begin in one eye but often spreads to involve both eyes.

## Causes of Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis is most commonly due to viral and sometimes bacterial infections. However, it can also result from:
- Allergic reactions
- Chemical irritants
- Air pollution
- Smoke
- Shampoos
- Dirt
- Swimming pool chlorine
- Noxious fumes

Rarely, underlying chronic inflammatory conditions can also cause a persistent conjunctivitis. The infectious form of conjunctivitis is very common in children and is highly contagious.

## Traditional Remedies

Traditionally, home remedies have been successfully used for soothing inflamed eyes with uncomplicated symptoms, minor infections, or allergies. Treatment consists primarily of cleansing the eyes and preventing the condition from spreading.

### Daruharidra Decoction

Daruharidra decoction is a popular traditional formulation mentioned in Ayurvedic texts for the management of uncomplicated conjunctivitis.

#### Daruharidra (Berberis aristata D.C.)

Daruharidra (Indian berberry) is a shrub or small tree, distributed in the temperate and subtropical parts of Asia, Europe, and America.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Daruharidra

Daruharidra has been in use (as eye drops/ointment) for centuries for prophylactic as well as curative purposes in common eye ailments like conjunctivitis. It is an important ingredient of many traditionally used formulations meant for local ophthalmic use, commonly as decoction and solidified water extract called Rasanjana.

# Haritaki Powder for Constipation

Constipation is a common problem which usually refers to persistent, difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation. Other expressions of constipation include the passage of unduly dry and hard faeces, sluggish action of the bowel, etc. It is important to note that it is virtually impossible to define what constitutes a “normal bowel movement” in terms of frequency. Generally, the frequency of bowel evacuation varies from person to person. As per a person’s tendency, lifestyle, and dietary habits, a frequency of defecation of 1-2 times per day to thrice a week is considered a normal bowel habit for that individual, unless it creates any discomfort or disturbs their routine life. The volume of stool passed differs greatly in different races.

Unsatisfactory bowel evacuation is the chief condition for the diagnosis of constipation. Some other symptoms which accompany or result from constipation are indigestion, flatulence, abdominal pain or discomfort, headache, and sleeplessness. The retention of hard faecal masses may give rise to spurious diarrhoea and, in extreme situations, can lead to intestinal obstruction, especially in frail and bedridden older individuals.

## Causative Factors for Constipation

1. Irritable bowel syndrome
2. Related to diet factors:
- Too bland food, e.g., with low fibre residue
- Too dry and astringent food
- Inadequate fluid intake
3. Intake of hard water
4. Metabolic diseases like hypothyroidism

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Obstructive Diseases of Lower Gastrointestinal Tract

## Causes of Constipation
1. Obstructive diseases of lower gastrointestinal tract
2. Drugs: opium, iron, blood pressure medicines
3. Irregular bowel habit
4. Sedentary lifestyle
5. Depressive disorders
6. Old age
7. Suppression of natural urge of defecation

## Ayurvedic Treatment for Constipation
In Ayurveda, various laxative drugs are mentioned to treat such conditions. One of the frequently used herbal laxatives is **Haritaki powder**, which is effective for treating constipation following certain lifestyle changes.

### Do's and Don'ts for Preventing Constipation
1. Persons suffering from constipation should not ignore the defecation urge nor should they strain for a long time to pass stools.
2. Drinking warm water and milk improves intestinal movements and is beneficial in relieving constipation.
3. Much deviation from the normal timing of meals and quantity of food should be avoided. It is beneficial to take soft, digestible, and semi-solid food.
4. Heavy and untimely meals, eating food before the digestion of earlier food, and intake of dry, astringent, and cold foods hamper intestinal movements, adding to constipation.
5. Regular walking, physical activity, deep breathing, and certain edibles like ginger, lemon, resins, dates, figs, and almond oil help in alleviating constipation.

## Haritaki (Terminalia chebula Retz.)
Haritaki powder is a simple formulation made from its dried ripe fruits. The plant is also known as **Pathya**, owing to its beneficial effects on the channels (patha) of the body. It is not only used for constipation but also for various gastrointestinal and systemic problems.

Scientific studies have established its stomachic, laxative, and anti-flatulence actions. Judicious use of Haritaki, along with necessary dietary and lifestyle changes, can successfully treat constipation and improve the physiological status of the gut.

# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care

## Sudden Altered Bowel Habit

Sudden altered bowel habit, alternate diarrhoea and constipation, or persistence of the constipation in spite of proper administration of Haritaki, are the signs of some serious pathological conditions inside the gut. Therefore, the underlying cause must be properly investigated and treatment should be taken under medical supervision only.

## Dietary Recommendations

Too dry a diet should be avoided and a diet with higher fibre content and liquids is advisable for the patient. Regular and proper lifestyle plays an important role in keeping the gut healthy.

# Pippali Powder for Cough

Cough is a reflex phenomenon characterized by a sudden, violent expulsion of air from the mouth, with or without sputum, after deep inspiration and closure of the glottis. This is the most frequent respiratory symptom. Coughing is an important way to keep the throat and airways clear. However, involuntary excessive coughing means there is an underlying cause that compels the person to cough.

## Types of Cough

The cough may be dry or productive:

- **Dry Cough**: There is only an explosive sound with no or little material coming out from the airways.
- **Productive Cough**: This type brings up phlegm or sputum, at times mixed with pus or blood or both.

Cough can be either acute or chronic:

- **Acute Cough**: Usually appears suddenly, goes away within 2-3 weeks, and is often due to common cold, flu, or sinus infection.
- **Chronic Cough**: Lasts longer than 2 to 3 weeks and is mostly a symptom of respiratory tract disease.

## Common Causes of Cough

Besides respiratory infections, namely tuberculosis, other common causes of cough include:

- Chronic tobacco smoking
- Naso-bronchial allergy
- Bronchial asthma
- Chronic bronchitis (with or without airway obstruction)
- Lung abscess
- Bronchiectasis
- Bronchogenic tumors
- Reflux disease of the gastrointestinal system
- Air pollution
- Heart failure
- Valvular heart disease
- Certain medicines used for the treatment of high blood pressure

The diagnosis of the cause of cough is essential before definitive therapy is initiated.

## Symptoms Associated with Cough

- **Painful Cough**: In association with fever indicates respiratory tract infection.
- **Intermittent, Ineffectual, and Exhausting Cough**: Occurs in chronic bronchitis and bronchial asthma, generally worst at night or on waking.
- **Loose Cough**: Readily productive of sputum in bronchiectasis and early stages of bronchial cancer.



# Cough and Its Management

## Overview of Cough

Production may be a relatively late development in lung tuberculosis. Loud and harsh cough without explosive character, called stridor, is found in whooping cough and in the presence of laryngeal or tracheal obstruction. Cough usually aggravates with change in temperature or weather. The explosive character of normal cough is lost in laryngeal paralysis. A short troublesome cough of old people due to chronic bronchitis recurs every winter and is called winter cough. Cough due to smoking is usually dry and irritating. Clinical and radiological evaluation is usually diagnostic in a large majority of cases. While definitive therapy may wait for diagnosis, symptomatic treatment usually provides relief.

## Ayurvedic Perspective on Cough

Ayurveda considers Kasa (cough) as a disease for which a specific line of treatment and various remedies are prescribed. Simple herbal remedies such as Pippali can successfully treat uncomplicated cough if patients observe the prescribed precautions along with medication. These are:

1. **Avoid**:
- Exposure to fumes and dust
- Sudden change of temperature in the surrounding
- Dry and spicy foods
- Chilled water and food
- Leafy vegetables and heavy meals

2. **Recommended**:
- Soft, hot, and easily digestible meals
- Edibles like honey, small cardamom, fresh ginger, radish, meat soup, goat milk, and resins help to control cough.

3. **Lifestyle Advice**:
- It is advisable to resort to sleeping during the day and not to suppress urges of stools, urination, and belching. Cough symptoms can be controlled easily with frequent drinks of warm water, mental relaxation, and less talking.

## Pippali (Piper longum Linn.)

Pippali powder is a single-ingredient herbal formulation made from the fruits of long pepper, an aromatic climber with perennial woody roots. The fruits are harvested around January while still green and unripe, as they are most pungent at this stage and of high medicinal value. Harvested fruits are dried in the sun until they turn grey or blackish.

The use of Pippali as a multipurpose drug is first documented in **Charaka Samhita**, where it is listed among Rasayana (rejuvenative and immuno-enhancer) drugs and largely mentioned for the treatment of cough, respiratory distress, gastro-intestinal disorders, pulmonary tuberculosis, etc. Besides codified knowledge about its uses, Pippali is largely used as a home remedy and in folk medicine.



# Pippali: A Traditional Spice and Medicine

Pippali is a commonly used spice in India and other Asian countries, renowned for its medicinal usage, particularly in treating common childhood ailments. It is regarded as a drug of choice for coughs of different origins. Ayurvedic practitioners in India widely use Pippali powder not only for symptomatic control but also for addressing the root causes of cough affecting the naso-respiratory, digestive, and blood systems. This popular plant medicine is indicated for naso-respiratory allergies, tuberculosis of the lungs, and immunodeficiency conditions. Pippali is described in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and in formulations in the Ayurvedic Formulary of India. Its simple formulation can be easily prepared at home for personal use. Scientific studies have proven its bio-availability enhancing, liver protective, and immuno-stimulatory actions.

## Composition

Pippali powder is made from the dried fruits of **Piper longum**.

| English Name | Long Pepper |
|--------------|-------------|
| Latin Name   | Piper longum Linn. |
| Family       | Piperaceae |
| Part Used    | Fruits |

- Alkaloids: piperine, sesamin, and piplartine.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Quality Standards

As per the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, quality standards determining the identity, purity, and strength of long pepper fruits are based on the following aspects:

| Quality Aspect                | Specification            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Foreign matter                | Not more than 2%         |
| Total ash                     | Not more than 7%         |
| Acid insoluble ash            | Not more than 0.5%       |
| Acid-soluble extractive       | Not less than 5%         |
| Water-soluble extractive      | Not less than 7%         |

Pepper powder under the microscope shows deep, moss-green color, fragments of parenchyma, oval or elongated stone cells, oil globules, and starch grains.

## Method of Preparation

1. Dried long pepper fruits are cleaned and powdered in a grinder or mortar.
2. Powder is sieved through a mesh of 85 size and kept in an air-tight plastic or glass container.
3. Exposure to moisture should be avoided. It is advisable to prepare at least 50 grams of powder at a time.

## Dosage Form

Blackish green powder with aromatic odor and pungent taste.

## Therapeutic Properties

Pippali powder has anti-inflammatory, anti-phlegmatic, decongestant, anti-spasmodic, expectorant, anti-allergic, appetizer, anthelmintic, immunostimulatory, and tonic properties.

## Dose and Mode of Administration

The adult dose of the formulation is 1 gram to 3 grams, and the children’s dose is 125 mg to 250 mg, two or three times a day, mixed with honey or warm water. Honey is the best vehicle for consuming Pippali powder. Jaggery or liquorice root powder may be used in place of honey if the cough is dry, irritating, and persistent. Warm water should be taken after consuming the medicine to facilitate its swallowing and fast absorption.



# Indications and Uses

1. **Pippali Powder** is indicated for:
- Acute and chronic cough due to:
- Common cold
- Pharyngitis
- Laryngitis
- Bronchitis
- Naso-respiratory catarrh
- Respiratory allergy
- Asthma
- Smoking

2. Non-specific cough is adequately manageable with **Pippali Churna**.

3. The formulation is also effective in controlling symptoms associated with cough, such as:
- Sneezing
- Hiccough
- Nasal discharge
- Fever
- Poor appetite
- Indigestion

# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. **Safety**: Pippali is regarded as safe in recommended doses. Ayurvedic literature does not specifically mention any toxicity or adverse effects from the use of Sitopaladi powder-like formulations, which include Pippali. However, long-term use of Pippali alone is not recommended in **Charaka Samhita**. Scientific studies have shown a 750-800 mg/kg dose as the LD-50 value of piperine in mice.

2. **Consumption**: Do not consume Pippali powder without mixing it properly with honey or warm water.

3. **Dietary Restrictions**:
- Fried and spicy foods
- Chilled drinks
- Curd and yogurt
- Smoking
- Exposure to cold
These should be avoided while suffering from cough. Frequent sipping of warm water helps facilitate the effect of the medicine in controlling cough, whether dry or productive.

4. **Medical Advice**: Patients with cough lasting over 10-15 days should seek proper medical advice for an exact diagnosis of the underlying cause and for necessary treatment.

5. **Diabetes and Obesity**: Patients with diabetes mellitus and obesity should use the formulation without honey or jaggery. Similarly, sugar and jaggery should not be taken with Pippali for long-term use in overweight and obese individuals suffering from chronic cough.

6. **Underlying Conditions**: The formulation could alleviate cough resulting from lung tuberculosis and tumors or cancer of the respiratory tract, but it is not a remedy for these underlying conditions.

7. **Blood in Sputum**: If the sputum is mixed with blood or frank blood is coughed out, do not attempt to treat cough with Pippali powder.



# Pippali Powder Usage Guidelines

## Cautions and Contraindications

1. **Stop Medication**
Stop medication with Pippali powder if symptoms aggravate and dryness of mouth, excessive thirst, and burning sensation in the body and urine appear.

2. **Long-term Use**
Owing to the hot and lubricating nature of Pippali, its excessive and long-term use is contraindicated in Ayurvedic literature. Ignorance about this fact may lead to untoward symptoms.

3. **Special Considerations**
Individuals with heat-dominating temperament and body constitution, as well as menstruating and pregnant women, should be careful in observing any unwanted effects while consuming Pippali powder. In case of adverse effects, medical advice should be sought promptly.

4. **Medical Advice**
Proper medical advice should be taken if cough accompanies:
- Difficulty in breathing
- Swelling of face or feet
- High-grade fever
- Expectoration with foul-smelling yellowish-green phlegm
- Blood in sputum
- Difficulty in lying down
- Night sweating
- Unintentional weight loss

5. **Antifertility Activity**
Pippali powder has a potent antifertility activity; therefore, it must be used with caution in the first trimester of pregnancy. Women planning for pregnancy should avoid the use of Pippali powder. However, the baby is not harmed if a lactating mother is taking this medication.

# Kutaja Powder for Diarrhoea

Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of abnormally liquid or unformed stools at an increased frequency, and denotes a change in the usual bowel movement. It is a symptom of various disease conditions of the gastrointestinal system and is often considered a disease itself. Diarrhoea can be acute or chronic based on its causes.

## Acute Diarrhoea

Acute diarrhoea lasts for hours or days, and the number of bowel movements usually exceeds three per day. The causes of acute diarrhoea can be infectious or non-infectious.

### Clinical Features of Acute Infective Diarrhoea

- Frequent stools, sometimes with blood and mucous
- Pain during passing stools
- Abdominal pain
- Vomiting
- Fever

Severe diarrhoea leads to dehydration, which manifests itself as:
- Apprehension
- Cold clammy skin
- Rapid pulse
- Deep and rapid respiration
- Inelastic skin
- Sunken eyeballs
- Dry tongue
- Scanty urine
- Low blood pressure

Untreated acute diarrhoea can be fatal. The non-infectious category of diarrhoea can be caused by drugs such as:
- Antibiotics
- Certain antidepressants
- Antacids
- Bronchodilators
- Chemotherapeutic agents
- Laxatives
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Additionally, spurious diarrhoea may follow chronic constipation, especially in older people and in association with psychological stress.

## Chronic Diarrhoea

Chronic diarrhoea lasts for weeks or months and may be either persistent or recurrent. The aetiology of chronic diarrhoea is usually related to structural and functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.

### Clinical Features of Chronic Diarrhoea

- Persistent or recurrent episodes with intervening periods of normalcy or constipation
- Stool volume may be large or small and may be watery, loose, bulky, or frothy
- Diarrhoea may be accompanied by abdominal pain

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care

*(Content not provided in the original text)*



# Diarrhoea and Its Management

Diarrhoea can cause discomfort and abdominal distension. Systemic symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, generalized weakness, and malaise may also be present. Untreated chronic diarrhoea can lead to malabsorption syndrome and malnutrition.

It is always important to understand the underlying cause of diarrhoea so that the right treatment can be planned. However, uncomplicated diarrhoea due to indigestion and infection can be managed with Ayurvedic formulations such as Kutaja powder along with necessary dietary precautions.

## Kutaja [Holarrhena antidysenterica (Roxb. ex Flem.) Wall.]

Kutaja powder is a simple formulation prepared from the stem bark of *Holarrhena antidysenterica* (Roxb. ex Flem.) Wall., a small to medium-sized tree found throughout India. The stem bark is collected from 8-12 years old trees during the middle of the rainy season (July to September) and again at the end of winter by hewing, peeling, and separating it from the attached wood. The stem bark is bitter in taste and is used in Ayurveda for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, particularly diarrhoea and dysentery. Most of the Ayurvedic formulations described in literature and various commercially marketed formulations for diarrhoea essentially contain Kutaja as one of their ingredients. Kutaja is mentioned in the Indian Ayurvedic Pharmacopeias as well as Formulary. Apart from the preferred use of Kutaja in the treatment of diarrhoea, scientific studies have established its anti-protozoal, anti-giardia, and anti-amoebic properties.

### Composition

Kutaja powder is prepared from the stem bark of Kutaja.

# Lashuna Oil for Earache

Pain in the ear is a very uncomfortable symptom, which may be due to local causes in the ear or may relate to external causes. The earache may increase on lying down due to increased blood supply to the ear in a recumbent position. The general causes of earache are as follows:

1. Exposure to extreme cold weather.
2. Exposure to pressure changes during diving or swimming and air travel.
3. Picking or probing the ear canal.
4. Improper instrumentation during the examination or treatment of the ear.
5. Exposure to very high-pitched sounds.
6. Injury to the head, especially the temporal bone.
7. Entry of water into the auditory canal during bathing.
8. Local bacterial or fungal infection such as furuncles and otomycosis.
9. Impacted wax.
10. Referred pain due to carious tooth, impacted molar, ulcerative lesions in the oral cavity and tongue, osteoarthritis of the temporo-mandibular joint, tonsillitis, etc.

The earache can also be functional, which needs to be carefully observed. Management of earache requires proper evaluation and treatment before complications develop. Ayurveda prescribes instillation of medicated oil and juice of certain medicinal plants in the treatment.

# Shirisha Powder for Eczema

Eczema is a term that denotes different types of allergic skin inflammation usually of chronic origin. The symptoms of eczema commonly include itching, reddened and dry skin. Since the skin is itchy, prolonged scratching leads to a leathery thickening of the skin. Cracking and weeping of the skin may also occur, and open sores may become infected.

## Causes of Eczema

Though the causes of eczema have not been fully determined, the following list provides some insight into the triggers for eczema:

1. **Family history**: There is a genetic component to this disease.
2. **Irritants**: Exposure to industrial solvents, chemicals, vehicle lubricants, soaps, cement, detergents, cleaning products, rubber gloves, and even cosmetic lotions and creams.
3. **Allergy**: Strong reactions to some allergens can cause violent skin eruptions.
4. **Chronic dry skin**: Dry skin that is left un-moisturized can develop into eczema, especially in cold weather.
5. **Poor circulation**: More common in the elderly and affecting lower limbs.
6. **Obsessive compulsive disorder**: Habitually rubbing or scratching skin.
7. **Reaction to an infection**: Some fungal, parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections can cause localized eczema.
8. **Stress**: Stress causes the immune system to be compromised, leading to increased susceptibility to skin conditions.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Eczema Management

## Dietary Modifications
1. **Diet**: Some have found modification to diet extremely useful in maintaining remission periods.
2. **Unknown Factors**: Some forms of eczema are triggered by unknown reactions of the immune system.

## Control of Eczema
Though eczema is very difficult to control, the allergic component of eczema can be managed to an extent by regular internal and external use of Shirisha, which is widely mentioned in Ayurvedic classics and used in clinical practice by traditional practitioners.

### Do's and Don'ts
1. **Avoid**:
- Excessive intake of sour, salty, and pungent foods and drinks
- Curd, milk, jaggery, sesame seeds, black gram, and alcoholic beverages
2. **Care for Oozing Eczema**:
- Keep the site clean and dry.
3. **Care for Dry Eczema**:
- Keep the affected area moist and smooth with Vaseline or an oily preparation.
4. **General Advice**:
- Avoid aggravating factors of eczema.
- Eat simple, soft, easily digestible food.
- Include edible items of bitter taste; regular use of honey and maintaining peace of mind help in the management of eczema.

## Shirisha (Albizzia lebbeck Benth.)
Shirisha consists of the powder of the bark of Albizzia lebbeck, a large, deciduous tree found all over India up to 900 meters in the Himalayas. It grows wild, especially in moist and dry deciduous forests. The bark of the tree is thick and dark or brownish-grey with numerous short irregular cracks. The seeds are oval or oblong, pale brown, smooth with a hard testa. Shirisha is described as one of the best Vishaghna (anti-toxin) drugs in Ayurvedic texts. Clinical studies show that Shirisha acts as an antidote to animal poisons that are histaminic in nature and are also responsible for the production of allergic dermatitis, urticaria, and anaphylactic shock.

### Composition
Shirisha powder is prepared from its bark for oral use and decoction for washing the affected skin.

# Triphala Decoction for Eye Discharge

Liquid discharge from the eye, other than tears, can occur with or without burning and itching. This symptom is common in various eye conditions and may also be caused by environmental pollutants. Eye discharge is frequently associated with inflammatory and allergic conditions of the eye.

## Common Conditions Associated with Eye Discharge

- **Viral Conjunctivitis**: The eye becomes red or bloodshot, and irritation leads to discharge. This condition typically lasts no more than 10 days if uncomplicated and proper hygienic care is maintained.

- **Bacterial Conjunctivitis**: Although not common, it can result in thick eye discharge that is white, yellow, or greenish in color. In such cases, it is advisable to seek medical advice.

## Uncommon Causes of Eye Discharge

- Cigarette smoke
- Chlorine in swimming pool water
- Chemicals in make-up materials

In these instances, eye discharge and associated symptoms appear upon contact with the irritant and do not last long. Specific medication is generally not required, but it is important to avoid the cause of eye irritation.

## Allergic Reactions

Thin, watery discharge accompanied by itching and burning in the eyes is often due to allergies, which can be quite uncomfortable. Identifying the cause of the allergy is essential for effective treatment.

## Ayurvedic Treatment Approach

For eye discharge, Ayurvedic literature recommends a simple principle of treatment: avoid the causative factor and alleviate the symptoms with medicines that have antagonistic properties.

### Triphala Decoction

Triphala decoction is a widely popular remedy considered effective in alleviating various eye symptoms, including discharge, inflammation, and irritation.

2. **Irrigation**: Ask the patient to lie down on their back. Irrigate the open eyes, one by one, with Triphala decoction poured through a clean and sterilized dropper. The procedure may be done twice or thrice a day.

3. **Akshi Tarpana**: With the patient lying down on their back, first clean the eyes with cotton or soft cloth soaked in clean water and then make rings of wheat-flour dough around both eyes. Put Triphala decoction in the rings in such a way as it may not spill out. Keep this position for 5 to 10 minutes and ask the patient to blink their eyes and move their eyeballs in between. This procedure should be done at least twice a day.

# Indications and Uses

Triphala decoction is used for washing eyes in acute and chronic infections and inflammatory diseases of the eye, including trachoma, where watery or purulent discharge is the main symptom. It is also recommended for oral use in various eye diseases.

# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. Due care must be taken to make and keep the decoction in a clean utensil. Do not keep the decoction uncovered and in an unhygienic place. Dipping fingers in the decoction to judge its temperature should be strictly avoided.

2. Too hot and too cold decoctions should not be used as they may not yield the desired results.

3. Frequency of eye wash should be determined based on the severity of symptoms. It is advisable to wash the affected eye at least twice a day, and for each application, fresh decoction should be prepared.

4. Warm compresses should be applied to soften and remove crusts in the eyelids before washing the eyes. Softened crusts can be removed with cotton.

5. Medical advice must be sought if vision is decreased, eye pain gets severe, the discharge is thick and frankly purulent or greenish or bloody, and light sensitivity is intense.

# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care

# Kiratatikta Powder in Fever

Fever, also known as pyrexia, is a common medical symptom as well as a sign that indicates an increase in internal body temperature to levels above normal. Fever results from a temporary elevation in the body’s thermoregulatory set-point, which is usually set at a normal temperature of 37ᵒ C (98.6ᵒ F). Body temperature varies with time of the day, with lower levels in the morning and higher levels in the evening.

Fever is present if oral temperature is over 37.2ᵒ C (98.96ᵒ F) in the morning and 37.7ᵒ C (99.86ᵒ F) in the evening; the corresponding rectal temperature (in the anal canal) would be 0.4ᵒ C (0.72ᵒ F) higher. In addition to diurnal variations, body temperature is also influenced by age and gender (especially women in the reproductive age group). Fever is not considered medically significant until body temperature is above 38° C (100.4° F).

There are different accompanying symptoms of fever, which depend on its underlying causes. These include chills, rigors, malaise, arthralgia, anorexia, fatigue, dizziness, sweating, etc.

Fever serves as one of the body’s natural defenses against microbes. For that reason, low fevers should normally go untreated unless accompanied by troubling symptoms. Fever is termed as low grade if it is between 38ᵒ–39° C (100.4ᵒ–102.2° F), moderate if it ranges within 39ᵒ–40°C (102.2ᵒ–104.0° F), and high grade if it is over 40° C (104.0° F).

Depending upon the course of fever, fever can be:

1. **Continuous fever**: If the temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than 1ᵒ C (1.8ᵒ F) in 24 hours; e.g., urinary tract infections, typhoid, lobar pneumonia.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Types of Fever

## 1. Intermittent Fever
- If fever touches baseline for several hours of the day.
- If the spike occurs every day, it is termed **quotidian**.
- A spike every alternate day is called **tertian**.
- If this occurs every third day, it is referred to as **quartan** intermittent fever (e.g., malaria).

## 2. Remittent Fever
- If the temperature remains above normal throughout the day with fluctuations of more than 1 degree Celsius (e.g., infective endocarditis).

## 3. Irregular Fever
- If the pattern does not fit into any of the patterns indicated above.

# Causes of Fever
1. **Infectious Diseases**:
- Viral infections
- Malaria
- Influenza
- Sore throat
- Typhoid
- Pneumonia
- Measles
- Chickenpox
- Tuberculosis
2. **Tissue Injury**
3. **Cancers**:
- Liver
- Kidney
- Lymph nodes
4. **Immuno-inflammatory Diseases**:
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Vasculitis
5. **Drugs and Toxins**
6. **Exposure to High Environmental Temperature**
7. **Fever of Unknown Cause**

## Risks Associated with Fever
The main risk of moderate to high fever is dehydration. Patients with fever need more fluids than usual. Body temperature greater than 41.67°C (107°F) can result in brain damage and possibly death.

## Management of Fever
Uncomplicated mild to moderate fever can be managed with a simple herbal preparation mentioned in Ayurvedic classics such as **Kiratatikta**.

# Karanja Powder for Fungal Dermatosis

Chronic fungal infection of the skin, hair, or nails is caused by specific species of fungi such as *Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, and *Epidermophyton*. In layman’s terms, the condition is called “ringworm” or tinea infection, which is extremely common in general practice. Ringworm is characterized by round lesions (rings) and there are multiple terms for ringworm infection of various body sites such as:

- **Tinea corporis** (body)
- **Tinea paedis** (feet)
- **Tinea unguium** (nail)
- **Tinea capitis** (scalp)
- **Tinea cruris** (groin)

It is highly contagious and can spread through contact with an infected person, animal, and objects like contaminated toilet articles, clothing, pool surfaces, showers, locker rooms, and even soil. Acquisition of ringworm appears to be favored by minor trauma (including that incurred during wrestling), maceration, and poor hygiene of the skin. Heat and moisture help fungi grow and thrive, which makes them more common in areas of frequent sweating as well as skin folds in groins or between toes.

The signs and symptoms vary with the site of infection and the fungal species involved. Foot infection (athlete’s foot, tinea paedis) may present as fissuring of the toe webs, scaling of the plantar surfaces, or vesicles around the toe webs and soles. Inter-digital lesions may be itchy but become painful when bacterial superinfection occurs. Hand infection is less common but resembles foot infection. Scalp infection (tinea capitis) is characterized by areas of alopecia and scaling. Nail infection (tinea unguium) presents as a white discoloration of the nails or as thickening, chalkiness, and crumbling of the nails. Tinea of the groin (‘jock itch’) tends to have a darkening of skin color and extends from the folds of the groin down onto one or both thighs.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Skin Fungal Infections and Karanja

Though skin fungal infections like ringworm are not easy to treat, recent uncomplicated infections can be managed by one of the most popular herbal powders and oils made from a single drug, Karanja, along with maintaining hygiene and following certain do’s and don’ts given in Ayurvedic literature.

## Recommendations for Treatment

1. Keep the affected part clean; wash it daily with warm water and wipe dry.
2. Local application of simple medicaments like neem oil, turmeric paste made with water, or sulphur ointment can provide added effect.
3. It is always advisable to continue the treatment for some time, even if symptoms come under control.
4. The cloth once used on the affected part should be reused only after washing and dipping in an antiseptic solution.
5. Curd and heavy foods should be avoided. Food items with a bitter taste are beneficial.

## Karanja (Pongamia pinnata Linn. Merr.)

Karanja, botanically known as *Pongamia pinnata* Linn., is a medium-sized tree with a short bole and spreading crown, found almost throughout India up to an altitude of 1200 meters. Karanja seeds are used both internally and externally for various types of skin ailments, including fungal skin diseases.

# Pippalimoola Powder for Headache

Headache is defined as a pain in the head or upper neck. It can be a symptom of an underlying serious disease or it can be a disease itself. Headaches can arise from many causes. Common benign causes of headache include:

- Migraine
- Refractory error
- Mental tension
- Sinusitis
- Flu
- Viral fever
- Typhoid

Some serious and life-threatening causes of headache include:

- Cerebral haemorrhage
- Sub-arachnoid haemorrhage
- Intracranial space-occupying lesions (tumour)
- Acute and chronic meningitis
- Brain abscess

Trigeminal neuralgia can be a difficult and intractable cause of headache, though it is not life-threatening. Sudden and severe headaches associated with symptoms like high fever, vomiting, convulsions, visual symptoms, stiffness in the neck, and loss of consciousness warrant urgent medical attention.

Mild to moderate headaches without any specificity can be managed with simple remedies such as Pippalimoola, which is specifically documented for the management of headache in Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia, Ayurvedic formulary, and various classical texts.

## Pippalimoola (Root of Piper longum Linn.)

Pippalimoola refers to the roots of the Pippali (long pepper) plant. The roots are perennial, woody, and aromatic, and are used in powder form with warm water, milk, or preferably with ghrita (clarified butter). Many references regarding the therapeutic use of Pippalimoola are available in ancient classical Ayurvedic texts for its carminative, antispasmodic, and sedative actions. The use of ghrita with Pippalimoola is emphasized because of its ability to negate the hot and dry properties of Pippalimoola and facilitate drug action for alleviation of vitiated Vata dosha.

----

**Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care**



# Headache and Ghrita

Considered as the underlying bio-humour responsible for the causation of headache, Ghrita is also known to be beneficial for mental faculties. It is recommended for use alone or with medicinal formulations for psychological problems including stress-induced headache, disturbed sleep, and impaired mental concentration.

## Composition

Pippalimoola powder consists of roots of Pippali.

# Chaturbhadra Decoction for Indigestion

Improper digestion of food usually results from overeating, frequent eating without having the feeling to eat, untimely eating, emotional outbursts, and improper sleep. Decreased secretion of digestive juices is a relatively less common cause of indigestion. Usually, there is a relative deficiency of digestive enzymes, an imbalance of the gastrointestinal environment, and impaired movement of the intestines. In order to facilitate proper digestion, food should be taken on time, in the right amount, and should be of proper contents.

Individuals with a stressful lifestyle mostly suffer from persistent low-grade indigestion with acute attacks in between because of dietary indiscrimination. Indigestion can also result from gastrointestinal infection, consumption of contaminated food, or due to certain medicines, which cause irritation in the stomach and in the upper part of the intestine.

Indigestion becomes apparent with a feeling of fullness or heaviness in the abdomen, low appetite, nausea, abnormal taste in the mouth, and disturbed bowel movements in the form of constipation or loose motions. In acidic indigestion, sour eructation or belching and water brash are usually present. Indigestion is primarily a self-limiting condition manageable with avoidance of solid food for a day or two, followed by the intake of soft, light, and easily digestible food for a couple of days.

Severe and prolonged indigestion, however, always needs medication and can be effectively managed with simple digestive herbal formulations such as Chaturbhadra decoction.

# Katuka Powder for Jaundice

Jaundice is yellowish discoloration of the sclera (white part of the eyes) and skin caused by high levels of bilirubin in the blood. It is a major symptom and sign of serious disease of many organ systems; most important among them being the liver. Jaundice is often associated with yellow urination, which reflects excessive excretion of bilirubin in the urine as well. There is a direct correlation between the blood levels of bilirubin and the extent of tissue discoloration.

Jaundice reflects a deranged state of bilirubin metabolism. Bilirubin is a waste product produced in the body from the globin part of hemoglobin, which is released from the destruction of old red blood cells and remains in the blood after iron is removed. It is the liver that is responsible for removing bilirubin from the blood by conjugating it and then secreting bilirubin-containing bile into the intestine via bile ducts. Jaundice may result from the following three main conditions:

1. **Over-production of Bilirubin**: This occurs when the production of bilirubin exceeds the capacity of the liver to remove it from the blood. This type of jaundice is found in excessive breakdown of red blood cells due to their defective formation, or due to the effect of toxins or certain drugs when a large amount of bilirubin is released into the blood.

2. **Functional Disturbance of the Liver**: This prevents the removal, conversion, and secretion of bilirubin. It is characteristic of hepatitis.

3. **Blockage of the Bile Ducts**: This causes reduced flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines. It is seen in conditions where bile ducts get obstructed due to gallstones, cancer, or inflammation.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Symptoms

If the jaundice is due to liver disease – hepatitis, the patient apart from yellowish colouration of eyes and skin may have symptoms like loss of appetite, mild fever, fatigue, weakness and exhaustion. The liver may be slightly enlarged and tender. The stool may be light in colour but the urine is yellow.

In haemolytic jaundice, the patient suffers from anaemia and both the urine and stool are of orange colour. In jaundice caused by blockage of the bile ducts, bile does not enter the intestines so there is impairment of fat digestion and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. This condition leads to fatty stools and deficiency symptoms of fat-soluble vitamins. The stool is clay-coloured in obstructive jaundice because of the absence of bilirubin that normally gives stool its brown colour. A troublesome symptom found in patients with this type of jaundice is itching, which may be as severe as to cause scratching and disturbed sleep.

The patient’s history can suggest the possible cause for jaundice. For example, excessive use of alcohol is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease, whereas use of hepatotoxic drugs suggests drug-toxicity-induced jaundice and sharing of syringes for injection of drugs points towards viral hepatitis. Attacks of abdominal pain in a patient with jaundice suggests blockage of the bile ducts usually by gallstones. Bulky and clay coloured stools and dark urine suggests obstruction in the passage of bile.

Judicious use of Katuka powder along with necessary dietary precautions can successfully treat uncomplicated jaundice.

## Katuka (Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth.)

Katuka is a perennial hairy herb grown in alpine regions with temperate climatic conditions. The medicinal plant in Indian medicine is named as Katuka or Katuki owing to its immense bitter taste. The rhizome of the plant is a bitter tonic used for the treatment of febrile and liver disorders. Uses of Katuka are documented in the ancient classical texts – Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita.

Most of the Ayurvedic remedies described in literature and commercially manufactured for jaundice and liver disorders essentially contain Katuka as one of the ingredients. Katuka and its formulations find mention in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and the Ayurvedic Formulary of India. Apart from highly preferred use of Katuka in the treatment of jaundice and related diseases by Indian practitioners, scientific studies have established that it has an anti-inflammatory property, provides liver protection and improves bilirubin excretion.



# Composition

Katuka powder is made from dried rhizomes and roots of the plant for oral use.

## Botanical Information

- **English name:** Picrorhiza, Hellebore
- **Latin name:** Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth.
- **Family:** Scrophulariaceae
- **Part used:** Rhizome with roots

# Ajamoda Powder for Joint Pain

Joint pain or arthralgia is caused by inflammation or degeneration of tissues in one or more joints. When associated with stiffness, swelling, and painful joint movement, it is called arthritis. Joint pain can be a manifestation of acute febrile illnesses, trauma, excessive mechanical stress, a variety of medical conditions elsewhere in the body, or a more serious form of disabling arthritis which may be infective, non-infective, or degenerative. The common non-infective joint diseases with joint pain as a major symptom are rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, and non-specific inflammatory arthritis such as psoriatic arthritis.

## Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks the joints, producing an inflammatory synovitis that often progresses to destruction of the articular cartilage and ankylosis of the joints. Although the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, auto-immunity plays a pivotal role in its chronicity and progression.

The onset of rheumatoid arthritis in a majority of patients is insidious. Morning stiffness is its characteristic feature, and before the involvement of the joints, the patient may complain of tiredness, fatigue, general malaise, low-grade fever, etc. Generally, the small joints of fingers or toes are initially involved, then it spreads to the wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles, and knees. The temporo-mandibular joint and sterno-clavicular joint may also be affected.

As the disease progresses, the pain and swelling of the joints increase. Swelling of the proximal inter-phalangeal joint and muscular atrophy gives rise to a spindled shape of the fingers. Suggestive clinical features with consistent radiological changes, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a positive rheumatoid factor test usually help in diagnosing the disease.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative arthritis resulting from excessive mechanical stress on a diseased or degenerated joint. It generally involves big weight-bearing joints such as the knee, hip, and spine, but in women, it may involve the terminal joints of the fingers. The patients are frequently obese. Pain in joints initially is intermittent and appears after using the joints and is relieved by rest. With the progression of the disease, movement in the affected joints becomes increasingly limited. Crepitus is felt or heard in the affected joints. Bony outgrowths may appear on the joint margins.

# Gouty Arthritis

Gouty arthritis is a form of arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals inside the joint, which evokes an acute inflammatory response. It is one of the most painful joint diseases. Gouty arthritis usually strikes a single joint, most commonly the big toe; however, it can also affect the ankles, knees, wrists, fingers, and elbows. Elderly males are more likely to develop gouty arthritis than women.

# Psoriatic Arthritis

Psoriatic arthritis is a prototype of a group of chronic non-specific arthritis secondary to a primary immuno-inflammatory disease elsewhere, like skin psoriasis. The exact causes are not yet known, but several genetic associations have been identified. Psoriatic arthritis can develop at any stage. However, on average, it tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of psoriasis. For the majority of people, this is between the ages of 30 and 50, but it can also affect children. Men and women are equally affected by this condition, and the arthritis symptoms may occur before any skin involvement.

# Ayurvedic Treatment for Arthritis

Of the many drugs and preparations for arthritis documented in Ayurveda, Ajamoda powder is a simple and effective remedy. It is used internally as well as on the affected joints of the patient in the form of a poultice.

## Ajamoda (Apium leptophyllum) (Pers.) F.V.M. ex Benth.

Ajamoda consists of dried, aromatic fruits of *Apium leptophyllum*, an annual herb cultivated in the central and southern states of India. It is collected by thrashing plants on a mat and dried in shade or in drying sheds. Ajamoda is a well-known drug for rheumatism and gout. Ajamoda is one of the chief ingredients in many formulations.

# Lodhra Powder for Leucorrhoea

Leucorrhoea is a whitish mucous discharge from the female genital tract. The basic cause of this problem is overproduction of secretions from the genital tract due to continuous irritation. Mostly, there is a change in the vaginal flora due to a change in pH. Vaginal infection is the most common cause, which usually results from poor hygiene. Other causes of leucorrhoea include:

- Ill health
- Under-nourishment
- Marital disharmony
- Psychological and endocrine disturbances
- Genital tract inflammation
- Any growth in the uterus
- Use of contraceptives

Leucorrhoea without any underlying pathological condition is seen in early pregnancy, sexual excitement, and at puberty. This type of leucorrhoea needs no medication but assurance, as it may correct itself, though excessive secretions are sometimes enough to keep the vulva moist and stain the under-clothing.

## Differentiation of Underlying Causes of Leucorrhoea

The underlying causes of leucorrhoea can be grossly categorized according to the period of a woman’s life:

1. **Leucorrhoea at an early age (up to puberty)**: Usually occurs due to inflammation of the vagina.
2. **Post-puberty leucorrhoea (up to marriage)**: Usually occurs from poor genital hygiene, vaginal infection, ill health, and anaemia.
3. **Post-childbirth leucorrhoea**: Occurs mainly due to vaginal or cervical tear. Leucorrhoea during the childbearing age after the birth of the first child usually occurs due to cervical erosion or chronic infective inflammation of the cervix and vagina, use of contraceptives, excessive vaginal medication, or use of tampons.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Leucorrhoea Management

## Causes of Leucorrhoea

1. **Pre-menopausal leucorrhoea** results from:
- Uterine polyps
- Fibroid
- Carcinoma
- Prolapse

2. **Post-menopausal leucorrhoea** is mainly the result of:
- Genital tract growth
- Uterine prolapse
- Senile changes in the vagina

## Management of Leucorrhoea

Leucorrhoea without severe pathologic conditions can be successfully managed with a simple remedy such as a powder made from Lodhra bark and by following certain do’s and don’ts in the Ayurvedic texts. These are:

1. **Do’s:**
- Nutritious diet
- Proper physical activity
- Mental relaxation
- Regular bowel habits
- Local hygiene

2. **Don’ts:**

# Dhattura Paste for Lice Infestation

Pediculosis is an infestation of the skin, hair, or genital region caused by small insects called lice, which live directly on the body or in garments. The lice are small wingless parasites with sucking mouth parts that feed on human blood and lay their eggs on body hairs or in clothing. Lice infestation itself is not dangerous but is a serious public health problem because some lice can carry microorganisms that cause diseases like relapsing fever, trench fever, and epidemic typhus.

Lice infestation usually occurs due to poor upkeep and hygiene of hairy body parts for want of adequate facilities for bathing and washing of clothes, particularly undergarments. Any individual could get lice infestation; children with long hair are, however, more prone to suffer.

The most common site for lice infestation is the scalp, and it is transmitted from one person to another by close contact and by sharing of combs and hair brushes. Head lice infestation in epidemic form is common in school-going children. Adult lice can be seen on the patient’s scalp close to the base of hairs and around the ears, and these may spread from the scalp to the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard in adults, although they are more often limited to the scalp in children. Grayish-white eggs called nits may also be visible along with lice. Nits are premature forms of lice, which take 3 to 14 days to hatch. Infestations of body lice and pubic lice are seen in individuals who maintain poor personal hygiene, wear the same clothes and vests continuously without laundering, do not bathe regularly, and share bedding or clothes or towels with infected persons.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Lice Infestation

The common symptom of lice infestation, irrespective of body location, is itching, usually with injury to the skin caused by scratching or scraping. The itching may be intense and may be followed by bacterial infection of skin that has been scratched open. The itching results from an allergic reaction to a toxin that is present in the saliva of the lice. Diffuse skin eruption or inflammation can result with repeated bites of lice.

## Complications of Lice Infestation

Another common complication in head lice infestation is swelling or inflammation of the neck glands. Patients with body lice often have intense itching with deep scratches around the folds of shoulders, flanks, or neck. The bites first appear as small red pimples but may cause a generalized skin rash. If the infestation is not treated, the patient may develop complications that include headache, fever, and bacterial infection with scarring. Pubic lice may sometimes produce small bluish spots on the patient’s trunk or thighs.

## Prevention

Prevention of lice infestation and re-infestation is tedious, requiring avoidance of close contacts with infected persons, sharing of garments, towels, etc. Maintenance of adequate body hygiene is more important than the treatment. Local application of the paste of certain medicinal plants and medicated oils is in practice in India for the treatment of lice infestation.

Some commonly used formulations are documented in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and Ayurvedic Formulary of India. Dhattura paste is one such formulation that is widely used in rural areas because of its effectiveness in killing lice.

### Dhattura (Datura metel Linn.)

Dhattura is a popular medicinal plant of India documented for its anti-lice efficacy in the classical Ayurvedic literature. Bhavamishra describes the use of Dhattura seeds for the treatment of Yuka (lice) and Liksha (nits). The plant is enlisted in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, providing pharmacopoeial standards and uses of the whole plant and seeds.

The Dhattura plant grows as a weed throughout India. The plant is an erect and succulent annual herb or shrub about one metre in height with often purplish branches and triangular ovate leaves, bell-shaped flowers having purplish colour outside and white inside, and round, thorny fruits. Dhattura seeds are light brown to yellowish brown in colour, odourless, kidney-shaped, about 0.6 centimetre in length and 0.4 centimetre in width, compressed, flattened, and thickened towards the curved edge with a bitter and acrid taste.



# Composition

The paste for application over lice-infested parts consists of Dhattura seeds.

## Dhattura Information

| English Name | Thorn apple |

## Main Chemical Constituents

Tropane alkaloids such as hyoscyamine, atropine, scopolamine, etc., and fixed oil.

## Quality Standards

Quality of Dhattura is estimated on the basis of the following physical constants.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Dhattura Preparation and Usage

## Quality Standards

| Parameter                     | Specification          |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Foreign matter                | Not more than 2%       |
| Total ash                     | Not more than 6%       |
| Acid insoluble ash            | Not more than 1%       |
| Acid-soluble extractive       | Not less than 5%       |
| Water-soluble extractive      | Not less than 7%       |

## Method of Preparation

1. Fresh mature leaves of Dhattura are plucked and ground in a mortar or grinder with a little water. The juice is expressed from the ground leaves for application the same day.

2. For making a paste, dry seeds are first finely powdered and then mixed properly with an equal amount of water or mustard oil.

3. Adding mustard oil to the leaf juice or seed powder enhances the anti-lice effect of Dhattura.

4. The body part where juice or paste of Dhattura is to be applied should not be wet, and it is better to use the medicament at night to derive optimal effect.

## Dosage Form

- Greenish juice of leaves
- Yellowish-brown oily powder of seeds

## Therapeutic Properties

Dhattura is known to have strong nematicidal, analgesic, anti-viral, anthelmintic, and anti-spasmodic properties, making it useful in treating lice infestation and associated symptoms.

## Dose and Mode of Administration

1. The amount of leaf juice or seed powder required for application depends upon the size of the affected area. Usually, 25 to 30 millilitres of leaf juice or 5 to 10 grams of seed paste, made with 15 to 20 millilitres of water or mustard oil, is required for a single application on the scalp. The paste of powdered seeds is preferred over leaf juice in case lice infestation is confined to the head.

2. Fresh juice of Dhattura leaves or paste of seeds is to be applied uniformly over the affected area with hands and left for at least three to four hours, then washed with plain water.



# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care

## Application Instructions

1. The juice or paste should be applied against the direction of hairs to provide maximum exposure to the insects. The longer the medicine remains in contact with the body, the better the results seen. Due care must be taken to ensure that the medicine is applied close to the base of the hair on the scalp and other parts of the body.

2. Washing the hair with shampoo before or after applying the medicine should be avoided as it dilutes the medicine’s effectiveness.

3. Dead lice or nits should be removed manually or with a comb after the paste or juice has dried.

4. Application of Dhattura leaf juice or paste of seed powder should be done consecutively for three to five days till all lice and nits are killed and removed. Further hair wash should be done at least two days after the completion of the course of treatment.

## Indications and Uses

Lice infestation with or without nits in the head, pubic, and other regions of the body and associated symptoms of itching and skin rash is the main indication for the use of Dhattura paste or juice on affected parts.

## Precautions and Safety Aspects

It is important to observe the following precautions:

1. Dhattura is a poisonous medicinal plant and hence it should be used with care.

2. While applying or removing leaf juice or seed paste of Dhattura, due care must be taken that the medicine does not get into the eyes, mouth, ear, nose, and other natural openings of the human body.

3. Remove the dead or partially inactivated lice with a narrow-tooth comb or manually.

4. Mixing Dhattura medication with other drugs with similar action is not desirable as drug to drug interaction is unknown.

5. The most important step in treating head lice infestation is to treat the person and other family members simultaneously with medication to kill the lice and prevent re-infestation and cross-infection.



# Treatment Guidelines for Lice Infestation

1. **Wash Clothes and Bedding**
- Wash clothes and bedsheets used by the infested person two days before the treatment is started.

2. **Clean Clothing After Treatment**
- The lice-infested person should wear clean clothing after each application of Dhattura medication.

3. **Post-Treatment Observation**
- In case a few live lice are found after two to three applications of medicine, but are moving more slowly than before, there is no need for further treatment. Comb the hair to remove such lice and wait for a day or two for the medicine to kill the remaining lice on the head.
- Whereas no dead lice are seen and lice are as active as before, the medicine may not be working. In such a situation, seek medical opinion and follow the doctor’s advice.

4. **Ongoing Checks**
- After a course of 2-3 days treatment, check the hair bases and comb hair with a nit-comb to remove nits and lice on alternate days. Continue to check for 2 to 3 weeks until it is assured that all lice and nits are killed and removed.

5. **Cleaning Clothing and Accessories**
- To kill lice and nits present in the clothing and bed linen that was used during two days before treatment, wash them using hot water with not less than 130°F temperature or dry laundry using high heat for at least 20 minutes. Similarly, combs and hair brushes should be dipped in hot water and washed with soap.
- Clothes such as coat, scarf, cap, etc. should be dry cleaned.

6. **Preventing Re-infestation**
- In order to prevent re-infestation, all such activities should be avoided that are likely to spread lice such as head-to-head contact during play and at home; sharing of clothes and towels, hair brushes and combs; and lying on beds, sofas, couches, pillows, carpets, or stuffed animals that have recently been in contact with an infested person.

# Ashvagandha Powder for Malaise

Malaise is a symptom of psychosomatic origin characterized by a general feeling of illness or lack of well-being. It may be accompanied by discomfort, fatigue, lassitude, restlessness, loss of strength, and lack of interest and drive. This symptom is usually a vague sense of ill-being and exhaustion seen in patients suffering from any significant febrile infection and metabolic or chronic disease.

The mechanism of development of malaise is not fully understood and may result from the excessive presence of reactive molecules called free radicals. These molecules cause oxidant injury to the body cells, and an inadequate supply of antioxidants in the diet leads to a decline in the levels of antioxidants with increasing age. The onset of malaise may be sudden or staggering depending upon the nature of the underlying disease.

Malaise associated with other symptoms indicates significant illness. The following is a list of conditions that mostly cause malaise:

1. Acute infectious diseases like pneumonia, influenza, and viral fever.
2. Chronic infectious diseases like AIDS, parasitic disease, hepatitis, and tuberculosis.
3. Organ-specific chronic diseases like heart failure, obstructive lung disease, kidney failure, and liver disease.
4. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Endocrinal Disorders and Their Impacts

1. Endocrinal disorders like diabetes mellitus, dysfunction of the thyroid and adrenal glands.
2. Various cancers like leukaemia, lymphoma, colon cancer, and solid malignant tumours.
3. Severe anaemia.
4. Mental illness such as depression.
5. Medication with anti-convulsant, anti-histaminic, psychotropic, and beta-blocker drugs, and multi-drug treatments.

## Herbal Medicines in Ayurveda

Certain herbal medicines called **Rasayana** in Ayurveda are proven to have excellent anti-oxidant, immune-enhancer, anti-infective, anti-degenerative, and anti-stress effects. **Ashvagandha** is one such medicinal herb, which helps in many ways in the restoration and maintenance of health and vitality and to reinforce the psychosomatic mechanisms involved in preventing and treating malaise of varied origin.

### Ashvagandha Powder (Withania somnifera Dunal.)

Ashvagandha is a perennial shrub, found in wastelands, cultivated fields, and open grounds throughout India. It is widely cultivated in India. The roots are collected in winter, washed, and cut into short pieces. Ashvagandha is one of the most commonly used medicinal plants in Indian medicine for a varied range of physical and psychological ailments. It finds mention in almost all classical compendia of Indian medicine, particularly in the context of rejuvenation therapy.

The plant is best known for its tonic, anti-stress, and vigour- and vitality-enhancing properties. The root of the plant is used as such in powder form or in combination with other medicinal plants in various kinds of formulations mentioned in official formularies and pharmacopoeia of India.

A lot of scientific work has been done on Ashvagandha proving it to be useful as an immunomodulator, antioxidant, and adaptogenic. Due to these very beneficial effects, Ashvagandha is preferred for adjuvant use in the management of various psychosomatic, infectious, and drug-induced ailments and nutritional deficiency states with malaise as a main symptom. Ashvagandha improves tissue vitality, physical and mental endurance, and neuromuscular strength.

# Shatpushpa Powder for Painful Menstruation

Painful menstruation, also known as dysmenorrhoea, is a common problem for women in the reproductive age group. There are several causes attributed to this condition, such as congenital malformation of the genital tract, mechanical obstruction, infection, vascular congestion, and sometimes psychogenic causes. The nature, severity, and timing of pain vary from individual to individual depending on the underlying cause, tolerance capacity, and the individual’s perception of the condition.

Pain may occur before, during, and after menstrual flow. Sometimes, it may occur between menstrual periods. The pain can be dull and continuous with a sense of heaviness in the pelvic region and can also be intermittent and spasmodic. Anxiety, stress, and unsatisfied sexual stimulation contribute significantly to induce or aggravate dysmenorrhoea without any structural or pathologic cause.

## Types of Dysmenorrhoea

- **Primary Dysmenorrhoea**: Present from the time of menarche (onset of menstruation), also termed as congenital or essential.
- **Secondary Dysmenorrhoea**: Results from congestive, inflammatory, obstructive, and functional conditions of the genital tract.

## Management of Painful Menstruation

# Palasha Powder for Parasitic Infestation

Parasites are organisms that live on or inside humans or other organisms from which they obtain nutrients to survive. There can be many different types of parasite worms living in human bodies. Some are microscopic while others can be seen quite easily. These parasites or their eggs can be found in the environment, in the air we breathe, in the water we drink, or in the food we eat. These parasites may be pathogenic or non-pathogenic.

## Pathogenic Parasites

Pathogenic parasites cause harm because they consume the nutrients of the host, invade body tissues and cells, and produce toxic waste, which makes people sick. Moreover, most parasites also require a host to complete their life cycle. One third of the world’s population is infected with one or more species of intestinal parasites – easy victims being children. These infections impair children’s growth and development. Studies have shown an association between parasitic infection and under-nutrition, iron deficiency anaemia, stunted growth, poor school attendance, and poor performance in cognition tests.

## Modes of Transmission

People can become infested by intestinal parasites through:

1. Walking barefoot on soil contaminated with faeces of humans, dogs, cats, etc.
2. Eating raw or undercooked pork, beef, or fish that are infected.
3. Eating contaminated raw food, fruits, and vegetables.
4. Eating food prepared by infected handlers.

# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Intestinal Parasitic Infestation

## Causes of Infection
1. Drinking contaminated water.
2. Poor hygiene or sanitation.
3. Contact with infected persons (sexual contact, kissing, sharing drinks, shaking hands, or sharing toys).
4. Inhaling dust that contains parasitic eggs or cysts.
5. Playing with or picking up pet litter contaminated with parasitic eggs or cysts.

## Portal of Entry into the Body
In the case of internal parasites, the most common portal of invasion is through the mouth. This is the entrance for intestinal protozoa and helminths such as roundworm, pinworm, etc., in the fully embryonated egg stage. A few important infestations, such as species of hookworms, strongyloides, and dog tapeworm, enter the body from the soil via the skin route.

## Symptoms and Signs
The symptoms and signs of intestinal parasitic infestation can be variable and include:
- Dyspepsia
- Diarrhoea
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Abdominal cramping and pain
- Constipation
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Anaemia
- Joint and muscle aches
- Fever
- Rash
- Frequent colds and influenza
- Cough
- Itching anus
- Blood and/or mucus in the stools or foul-smelling stools
- Visible worms in the stools
- Itching on the genitals
- Grinding of teeth in sleep

Sometimes these parasitic infestations can be life-threatening in people with severe impairment of immune function.

## Common Intestinal Parasites
The most common intestinal parasites to infect humans are:
1. **Protozoa**:
- Giardia intestinalis (Giardia lamblia)
- Entamoeba histolytica
- Cryptosporidium species
2. **Intestinal Helminths**:
- Roundworm
- Hookworm
- Pinworm
- Threadworm
- Whipworm
- Tapeworm

These parasitic infestations, particularly roundworm, threadworm, and giardia, can be treated with a single herbal drug named Palasha beeja powder along with maintenance of hygiene and following certain do’s and don’ts.



# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care

- Healthy eating habits and timely meals are important.

## Palasha (Butea monosperma (Lam.) Kuntze)

Palasha is a deciduous, medium-sized tree with a somewhat crooked trunk and irregular branches, found in the dry deciduous forests, open grasslands, and scrub forests of tropical zones.

Properly preserved seeds are flat, kidney-shaped, dark reddish-brown, thin, glossy, and rich in fixed oil with a faint odor and slightly acrid and bitter taste. Optimal potency of the seed and its powder lasts for about four months. It is used as a remedy for common ailments like worm infestation and skin diseases. The formulation is listed with given indications in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Tribal communities make use of fresh or dried seeds of Palasha in the form of a decoction or powder mixed with other herbs for the management of parasitic worm infestation.

# Gandhaka Ointment for Scabies

Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by infestation with the itch mite (*Sarcoptes scabiei*). It spreads by skin-to-skin contact with a person who carries the mite. Less commonly, scabies can spread through sharing of clothes and bedding. Scabies is most common among household members and sexual partners of affected individuals. It is also common in congested areas such as hostels, dormitories, army camps, prisons, nursing homes, and hospitals. In people with compromised immune systems and malnutrition, scabies can be an extensive disease characterized by skin thickening and a scaly rash, known as crusted scabies or Norwegian scabies.

The scabies mite cannot live more than three days without a human host, but it can survive up to a month when living on a human being and lays eggs on human skin, which hatch and grow into adult mites. The initial phase of infestation is asymptomatic. Subsequently, the disease manifests with intense itching, especially at night or while taking a hot water bath. The itching is due to an allergic reaction to the mites and their excreta or deposits in skin burrows.

## Symptoms

The skin lesions include red rashes and raised spots. Due to scratching, the skin may become crusty or scaly as the infection progresses. Early scabies rash may show little red bumps like hives, pimples, and tiny bites. Scabies usually begins in the body’s folds and crevices such as:

- Armpits
- Around the nipples of women
- On the penis of men
- Belt line
- Between the fingers
- Buttocks
- Elbows
- Inner thighs
- Wrists
- Skin under rings, bracelets, or watch bands

Except in infants and small children, the face, scalp, neck, palms, and soles are usually spared. Children may also exhibit irritability, sleeplessness, and tiredness due to itching. Secondary bacterial infections may occur over the scabies lesions, and in many cases, children are treated because of infected lesions.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care

*(Content for this section is not provided in the current text.)*



# Skin Lesions and Scabies

Secondary skin infection with Streptococcus bacteria can sometimes lead to acute glomerulonephritis, which is a serious complication of scabies.

## Curing Scabies

Curing scabies requires several precautions and efforts. A local application made from **Gandhaka**, as described in classical texts of Ayurveda, can help check the infection and reduce the spread of scabies.

### Gandhaka Ointment (Ointment of Sulphur)

Gandhaka ointment is an effective preparation made from Gandhaka (sulphur), Tila oil (sesame oil), and Siktha (bee wax). Both internal and external use of purified Gandhaka is mentioned in Ayurvedic classics as well as the Ayurvedic Formulary of India. External use of sulphur possesses parasiticidal and fungicidal properties attributed to the formation of hydrogen sulphide and pentatonic acid.

- **Tila** consists of dried seeds of *Sesamum indicum* Linn., a herb extensively cultivated throughout the plains of India. Tila oil extracted from sesame seeds is used in skin diseases such as erysipelas, vitiligo, hemorrhoids, gout, gonorrhea, alopecia, dental disease, burns, etc.
- **Bee wax** is obtained from the honeycomb of bees. In pharmaceuticals, it is an ingredient of paraffin ointment. Dermatological and cosmetic applications are probably the most common uses for bee wax and its extracts. Its effects on tissue regeneration and renovation have been well studied. Together with its bactericidal and fungicidal properties, bee wax provides many benefits in various applications in cosmetics. In plastic surgery, bee wax extracts are used for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue development.

### Composition

Gandhaka ointment comprises Gandhaka, Tila oil, and Siktha.

1. Take fine powder of Gandhaka in a ladle, add a little amount of clarified butter or ghee, melt it, and pour into the vessel which contains cow’s milk.
2. This process is repeated seven times.



# Preparation of Gandhaka Ointment

## Steps for Purification of Gandhaka

1. Collect the purified Gandhaka on cooling to room temperature and wash with plenty of lukewarm water.
2. After drying, prepare the fine powder of purified Gandhaka and preserve it for further use.

## Ingredients

Take the ingredients in the following proportion:

| No. | Ingredient            | Quantity   | Proportion   |
|-----|-----------------------|------------|--------------|
| 1   | Gandhaka powder       | 25 grams   | 1/4th part   |
| 2   | Siktha (bee wax)     | 100 grams  | 1 part       |
| 3   | Tila oil              | 500 grams  | 5 parts      |

## Apparatus Required

The apparatus required for preparing the ointment comprises:
- Mortar and pestle
- Steel vessel
- Spoon
- Gas stove or heating plate
- Weighing balance
- Thermometer

## Procedure

1. Tila oil is taken in a steel vessel and heated up to 130 °C and then cooled to 70 °C.
2. Dissolve small pieces of Siktha (bee wax) into the oil with continuous stirring till a homogenous mixture called Siktha taila is obtained.
3. Siktha taila is taken in a mortar and triturated with a pestle, adding Gandhaka powder till ointment-like consistency is achieved.

## Precautions

1. Over-heating of the oil should be avoided.
2. The trituration should be firm enough to avoid the formation of gritty particles.

## Dosage Form

The preparation has an ointment-like consistency with a light-yellow color and a peculiar strong smell.

## Therapeutic Properties

Gandhaka ointment has parasiticidal, fungicidal, and antiseptic properties.

## Indications and Uses

Gandhaka ointment is useful in:
- Fungal infections of the skin
- Scabies
- Eczema
- Application over chronic infective lesions



# Dose and Mode of Administration

1. Gandhaka ointment is applied externally on the affected parts of the body once or twice daily and left on the lesions for an hour or so.
2. Thereafter, the lesions should be cleaned with warm water.
3. Repeat the procedure daily for 7 to 10 days or till all the lesions disappear.

# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. Gandhaka should not be used in formulations without subjecting it to purification.
2. Persons sensitive to sulphur should not use this application.
3. If the skin lesions do not heal within a few days of application, proper medical guidance should be sought.
4. Gandhaka ointment should not be used on open wounds and lesions.
5. Persons with scabies having secondary bacterial infection should avoid the use of Gandhaka ointment.
6. Persons known to have scabies should avoid having close skin-to-skin contact until they have been cured.
7. If a member of a family has scabies, all other household members, sexual partners, and close contacts should be treated simultaneously.
8. Use gloves and gowns when treating others with a suspicious rash and itching.
9. Wash all clothing, towels, and bed linens that were used in the last three days by the affected person, with hot water.
10. Use the dryer at high heat rather than air drying. Since the mites cannot survive on nonliving objects for several days, place the objects that are not machine-washable such as coats and stuffed toys into a bag and store for a week.
11. Cut nails and clean them thoroughly to remove any mites or eggs.
12. Try to avoid scratching and keep all open sores clean and aseptic.

# Kapikacchu Powder in Sexual Dysfunctions

Sexual dysfunctions are characterized by disturbances in sexual desire and in the psycho-physiological changes that comprise the sexual response cycle. Such disturbances can cause marked distress and interpersonal difficulty in enjoying sexual intercourse. The sexual response cycle can be divided into the following phases:

## 1. Desire
This phase consists of fantasies about sexual activity and the desire to have sexual activity.

## 2. Excitement
This phase consists of a subjective sense of sexual pleasure and accompanying physiological changes. The major changes in the male consist of penile tumescence and erection. The major changes in the female consist of vasodilatation in the pelvis, vaginal lubrication, and expansion and swelling of the external genitalia.

## 3. Orgasm
This phase consists of a peaking of sexual pleasure, with the release of sexual tension and rhythmic contraction of the perineal muscles and reproductive organs. In the male, there is a sensation of ejaculatory inevitability, which is followed by ejaculation of semen. In the female, there are contractions (not always subjectively experienced as such) of the wall of the outer third of the vagina. In both genders, the anal sphincter rhythmically contracts.

## 4. Resolution
This phase consists of a sense of muscular relaxation and general well-being. During this phase, males are physiologically refractory to further erection and orgasm for a variable period of time. In contrast, females may be able to respond to additional stimulation almost immediately.

# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Sexual Dysfunctions

The sexual dysfunctions include:

1. **Sexual desire disorders**:
- Hypoactive sexual desire disorder
- Sexual aversion disorder
2. **Sexual arousal disorders**:
- Female sexual arousal disorder
- Male erectile disorder
3. **Orgasmic disorders**:
- Female orgasmic disorder
- Male orgasmic disorder
- Premature ejaculation
4. **Sexual pain disorders**:
- Dyspareunia
- Vaginismus

Sexual dysfunction may be lifelong when it is present since the onset of sexual functioning. The acquired type of sexual dysfunction develops only after a period of normal functioning. Psychological factors play a major role in the onset, severity, exacerbation, or maintenance of the sexual dysfunction.

## Kapikacchu

Kapikacchu is one of the famous herbal drugs mentioned in Ayurvedic classics for various types of sexual disorders.

### Kapikacchu [Mucuna pruriens (Linn.) D.C.]

Kapikacchu is an herbaceous, twinning annual climber found throughout India in the hills ranging up to 3000 ft. height. Hairs on the pods of this climber are similar to that of a monkey, which is why synonyms like Kapikacchu, Kapiloma, Kapi, Markati, and Vaanari are used for it. Most of the Ayurvedic remedies described in literature for treating sexual dysfunctions and infertility contain Kapikacchu seeds as one of the ingredients.

Two types of Kapikacchu seeds are described – wild and cultivated. The wild variety has better utility in clinical practice than the cultivated one, and black seeds are considered better than white ones.

### Composition

Kapikacchu powder consists of powdered seeds of Mucuna pruriens (Linn.) DC.

| English Name | Latin Name                     | Family    | Parts Used |

# Haridra Powder and Paste for Sprain

## Understanding Sprains

The stretch or tear of soft tissues around a joint, such as ligaments, is known as a sprain. Common symptoms and signs of a sprain include:

- Pain
- Swelling
- Bruising
- Instability
- Loss of function

One or more ligaments can be injured at the same time. The severity of the pain will depend on the extent of the injury, i.e., whether a tear is partial or complete and the number of ligaments involved.

A sprain can result from:

- A fall
- A sudden twist
- A blow to the body that forces a joint out of its normal position

This results in an overstretching or tear of the ligaments supporting that joint. Typically, sprains occur when people:

- Fall and land on an outstretched arm
- Land on the side of their foot
- Twist a knee

## Haridra (Curcuma longa Linn.)

Haridra powder, mentioned in Ayurvedic classics, is a simple formulation that is effective when taken internally as well as applied locally.

### Description

Haridra is a dried rhizome of a plant that grows to 2 to 3 feet in height with funnel-shaped yellow flowers. Haridra, or turmeric powder, is bright yellow in color. It has an earthy aromatic and spicy fragrance with a slightly bitter taste.

Turmeric is an important spice in India with medicinal value. Plants are gathered annually for their rhizomes, which are used fresh or in powder form. Turmeric is traditionally used locally and orally for sprains and the swelling resulting from them. It is known to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and may be used in various remedies.

# Lavanga Oil for Toothache

Toothache is a commonly encountered problem. Any inflammatory condition affecting the gums and tooth pulp gives rise to pain. The enamel of the tooth is insensitive to pain; toothache occurs only when the enamel is eroded. In most cases, toothaches are caused by problems in the teeth or gums, such as:

- Cavities
- Gum disease
- The emergence of wisdom teeth
- A cracked tooth
- Infected or inflamed dental pulp
- Jaw disease
- Exposed tooth root

After having one or more teeth extracted, a condition known as dry socket can develop, leading to extreme pain. The severity of a toothache can range from mild discomfort to excruciating pain, which can be chronic or sporadic. This pain can often be aggravated by chewing or by hot or cold temperatures. Severe pain may be considered a dental emergency.

Toothache is a common symptom of an acute tooth abscess. It is associated with persistent throbbing pain at the site of the infection. Putting pressure or warmth on the tooth may induce extreme pain. In some cases, a tooth abscess may perforate bone and start draining into the surrounding tissues, creating local facial swelling. In some cases, the lymph nodes in the neck get swollen and tender in response to the infection.

Though the cause of the toothache should be established before starting the treatment, topical application of clove oil to the affected area can be a first-aid management which is well-documented as an effective remedy in Ayurvedic classics.

## Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Lavanga (Syzygium aromaticum (Linn.) Merr. &#x26; Perry)

Lavanga is the dried flower bud of *Syzygium aromaticum*, a tree cultivated in many parts of the world and also to a considerable extent in South India. Flower buds are collected twice a year, in the months of October and February when they change colour from green to crimson, and are dried carefully and separated from their peduncles. Clove is a fragrant floral bud, black or brown in color, widely used in Indian cuisines. Its pungent aroma and flavour is very familiar from its use as a culinary herb.

The oil extracted from cloves is used as a home remedy for toothache. It is an ingredient of tooth powders, gargles, and chewing gums. The oil is also used as a local analgesic for hypersensitive dental cavities; a mixture of clove oil and zinc oxide is used in dentistry as a temporary filling for tooth cavities.

## Composition

Lavanga oil is extracted from the buds of clove.

2. If topical application of clove oil fails to relieve the pain, take dental consultation.
3. Clove oil application in deep dental cavities should be done carefully.
4. Clove is toxic; its oral use in large amounts (i.e., more than 3.7 g/kg body weight) may be life-threatening.
5. Enough information about safety is unavailable for the oral use of cloves and clove supplements in pregnant and breastfeeding women.

# Gokshura Powder for Urinary Disorder

Difficult urination or dysuria is a general term referring to disturbances of varied nature in urinary flow and consistency, but by and large this condition represents difficulty in passing urine. Other problems in the urinary system include kidney failure, urinary tract infections, stones in the kidney, ureter, and urinary bladder, prostate enlargement, and impaired bladder control. These problems usually manifest in the form of difficulty in urination, incontinence of urine, retention of urine, or abnormally altered amounts of urine.

## Causes of Urinary Problems

Urinary problems may be caused by the following:

1. **Increasing Age**: As one gets older, changes appear in the structure and capability of kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. These age-related changes tend to bring about disturbances in the production and flow of urine.
2. **Urinary Infections**: Infections can lead to various urinary issues.
3. **Urine Incontinence**: A decrease in the strength of pelvic muscles and bladder sphincters, usually associated with age, can cause incontinence, i.e., the inability to hold urine.
4. **Functional Damage to Kidneys**: Any illness or injury to the kidney and other parts of the urinary tract can impair urine formation and proper passing of urine.
5. **Uncontrolled High Blood Pressure and Diabetes**: Chronic obstruction in the path of urine and untreated prostate enlargement usually lead to a disturbance in kidney function.

## Symptoms of Urinary Disorders

Symptoms of various urinary disorders include:

- Frequent urination, particularly at night
- Burning or difficulty during urination
- Infrequent urination
- Presence of blood or any other abnormal component in the urine

# Urinary Disorders and Gokshura

Depending upon the extent and nature of the underlying condition, the following symptoms may be associated with the main urinary disorder indicating failure of renal functions including: loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, puffiness around eyes, swelling of hands and feet, darkening of skin, muscle cramps, high blood pressure, frequent headache, and itching all over the body.

Whatever may be the cause of a urinary disorder, it is always important to treat the symptom. Judicious use of Gokshura, a traditionally used medicinal herb, is effective in successful management of urinary disorders and should be resorted to, in case proper medical facility is not readily available and the patient is not suffering from severe symptoms of urinary disorder.

## Gokshura (Tribulus terrestris Linn.)

Gokshura is a prostrate, annual or biennial weed of the pasture lands growing in hot, dry and sandy regions in the rainy season. The herb has natural occurrence but it can be propagated by seeds. The fruits are small, rounded and spiny consisting of five woody chambers, each with many seeds. Harvesting should be done preferably in winter when the properly dried ripe fruits could be preserved to retain potency till the next rainy season. Fruits, roots and the whole plant alone or in combination with other medicinal plants are extensively used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of genito-urinary disorders ranging from difficulty in urination to urinary stones and sexual weakness. Simple and multi-ingredient formulations made of Gokshura are listed in the Ayurvedic Formulary and Pharmacopoeia of India, and scientific studies have provided enough evidence of its varied usefulness in urinary and other diseases.

### Composition

The powder and decoction of Gokshura are made from dried ripe fruits or the entire plant.

# Ela Powder for Vomiting

Vomiting is the oral expulsion of upper gastrointestinal contents resulting from contractions of the gut and thoraco-abdominal wall musculature. It is coordinated by the centres in the brain and is effected by neuromuscular responses in the gut, pharynx, and thoraco-abdominal wall.

## Causes of Vomiting

The causes of vomiting are diverse and include:

- Gastritis
- Indigestion
- Gastrointestinal infection
- Worm infestation
- Obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract
- Inflammatory diseases of abdominal organs
- Myocardial infarction
- Raised intracranial pressure
- Motion sickness
- Pregnancy
- Uraemia
- Drugs
- Acute hepatitis and liver failure
- Psychogenic factors

### Psychogenic Vomiting

Psychogenic vomiting, which occurs without any gastrointestinal cause, is seen in persons suffering from anxiety. It usually occurs in the morning upon awakening. Early morning vomiting is a frequent symptom in hypersensitive pregnant women during early pregnancy. This type of vomiting rarely occurs later in the day.

Common associated symptoms of vomiting resulting from gastrointestinal causes include:

- Water brash (regurgitation of stomach juices into the mouth)
- Nausea
- Loss of appetite
- Salty taste in the mouth

These symptoms do not accompany vomiting of psychogenic origin. Generally, this type of vomiting is a short-lived symptom and is manageable with diet regulation and simple medication.

### Consequences of Vomiting

Acute vomiting can lead to dehydration, fluid, and electrolyte imbalance. Chronic vomiting may result in weight loss.

## Importance of Diagnosis

Ascertaining the cause of vomiting is essential to rule out serious illnesses. However, irrespective of the cause and nature of vomiting, it is always important to treat this symptom to prevent fluid loss.

## Quality Standards
The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India provides quality standards of Ela seeds based on the following physical constants:

| Quality Parameter                  | Specification                  |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Foreign matter                     | Nil                            |
| Total ash                          | Not more than 6%              |
| Acid-insoluble ash                 | Not more than 4%              |

## Method of Preparation
1. Not more than one-year-old dried cardamom fruits with adequate aroma are taken in as much quantity as is required for making powder for medicinal use. Remove dust and any other foreign matter and the outer skin of the fruits before grinding the seeds to make powder. About 10 grams of seeds are sufficient for a treatment period of seven to 10 days.

2. Grind the seeds in a clean grinder or mortar to make a fine powder and filter it through a metallic sieve. It is difficult to make powder if the seeds are not properly dried due to the presence of high moisture content. The powder should not be filtered through coarse cloth as it absorbs the essential oil, which contains aromatic and bio-active chemical constituents.

# Ela (Cardamom) - Therapeutic Properties and Dosage

## Storage
Seed powder is then kept in a dry air-tight small bottle, away from direct sunlight where the temperature normally does not exceed average room temperature. Keeping the powder in hot surroundings should be avoided as it facilitates loss of volatile content leading to reduced therapeutic potency.

## Dosage Form
Brownish powder with a strongly aromatic odour and characteristic taste. The powder can be filled into capsules.

## Therapeutic Properties
1. Ela has cooling, anti-emetic, stimulant, carminative, digestive, stomachic, and appetizing properties.
2. Pharmacological studies have proven Ela seeds to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-spasmodic, anti-microbial, and anti-fungal properties.

## Dose and Mode of Administration
1. Seed powder of Ela (Cardamom) is recommended in a dose of 250 milligrams to 500 milligrams (about 3-4 pinches) for adults and 60-120 mg for children, two to three times a day with a little warm water or any soft, sweet syrup, e.g., honey. It is advisable to consume the powder on an empty stomach or half-an-hour before eating meals.
2. The best way to consume Ela powder for control of vomiting is to swallow it with a small amount of water or syrup. Intake with a large amount of water or any other liquid should be avoided.
3. In cases of vomiting due to indigestion, gastritis, pregnancy, and high levels of blood urea in kidney failure, it is advisable to administer concoction of Ela powder in small frequent doses for fast absorption of the medicine.
4. Concoction is prepared by putting half to one teaspoonful (2.5 to 5 grams) of Ela powder in 30 milliliters of warm water and kept as such for 30 minutes and then it is filtered on getting cooled. Infusion is given in the dose of 5 to 10 milliliters (one to two teaspoonfuls) at regular intervals and is to be consumed the same day.

## Indications and Uses
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Gastritis
- Indigestion
- Anorexia
- Excessive thirst
- Giddiness
- Bad taste of mouth



# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. Traditionally, cardamom seeds are regarded as safe owing to their use as a home remedy and a common spice in various food items and beverages. No adverse effect and toxicity is reported in the literature. However, there are reports that cardamom seeds can trigger gallstone colic and hence are not recommended for self-medication in patients with gallstones.

2. Patients with vomiting as a major symptom should take small meals in liquid or semi-solid forms made of soft easily digestible materials. Overeating, irregular eating, and heavy, fiber-rich, and spicy foods should be avoided.

3. Fresh concoction of cardamom seeds, as described above, should be used if the patient does not find seed powder palatable.

4. Strenuous work, anxiety, and stress should be avoided for successful management of vomiting. Adequate bed rest and sleep at proper times help a lot to enhance the effect of medication.

5. Medical advice should be sought if vomiting is drastic and is not controlled with Ela powder, and the patient’s condition deteriorates rapidly. The underlying cause of vomiting must be properly treated with suitable medication.

6. Mere symptomatic relief of vomiting should not be attempted if the condition gets severe and is non-responsive to self-medication with Ela powder and similar other home remedies.

7. Medication with Ela powder should be restricted to mild to moderate vomiting mainly resulting from gastrointestinal causes and pregnancy. Specific treatment of the underlying cause is required in kidney failure, cancer of the stomach, worm infestation, brain tumor, and psychogenic vomiting.

8. Ela powder is safe during pregnancy and for breast-fed children.

# Haridra Powder for Wound

Wounds are commonly encountered. Though extremely common, without proper and timely intervention, they may get complicated leading to sepsis, septicaemia, and scarring. Wounds are due to various types and intensity of physical injury wherein the skin is torn or punctured or a contusion is formed due to blunt force. Accordingly, a wound is called open when the skin is breached due to injury and closed when there is no tearing or cutting of skin. A wound is considered minor when it is superficial, away from natural orifices, with minor or no bleeding and not caused by a tool or instrument or animal.

Other types of wounds including stab and gunshot wounds and those with doubtful background are considered as major or severe and must receive proper medical attention. In severe open wounds, the risk of blood loss and infection is high. Such wounds need to be cleaned and covered until medical help is provided. Internal wounds are comparatively dangerous as the extent of damage to the tissues is not known.

Here, the term wound is confined to external and superficial injuries including incised wounds, lacerations, abrasions, puncture wounds, contusions, and mild haematoma. If not severe and complicated, wounds can be successfully managed with simple traditional medical care making use of Haridra.

## Haridra (Curcuma longa Linn.)

Haridra is a well-established medicinal plant of Indian medicine known for its wound healing properties. Classical medical literature is replete with the uses of turmeric and adequate evidence is available.



# Turmeric (Haridra)

Turmeric is renowned for its antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-allergic properties. The earliest reference to turmeric, along with its indications for skin diseases and wounds, is found in the Ayurvedic text *Charaka Samhita*.

## Uses in Ayurveda

The use of turmeric is recommended for facilitating wound healing in para-surgical procedures prescribed in Ayurveda, such as:
- Leech therapy for chronic wounds
- Kshara Sutra therapy for piles and fistula

Turmeric is the most common household medicine for the first-hand management of injuries and wounds. Its juice, paste, powder, decoction, and various formulations are used both externally and internally.

## Description

Haridra is the dried rhizome of a perennial herb from the Zingiberaceae plant family, extensively cultivated in all parts of India. It is harvested between October and April when the lower leaves of the plant turn yellow. The rhizomes are boiled, dried, and the skin is peeled off. Turmeric is available in the market in both raw and powdered forms. Powdered Haridra is an essential commodity in Indian homes, used as a condiment in almost all sorts of cooking.

## Composition

Haridra powder is made from a single herbal ingredient, Haridra.

| Volatile oil                    | Not less than 4% volume/weight |

Quality testing of turmeric is done by adding concentrated sulphuric acid or a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid and alcohol to the powdered turmeric. The appearance of deep crimson colour confirms the quality.

## Method of Preparation
1. Powder of turmeric is prepared by grinding dried rhizomes in a grinder or pulverizer and then sieved through mesh size 80. The powder should be kept in a clean container and stored in a dry area away from direct sunlight.
2. Decoction of turmeric for washing wounds is made by boiling 10 grams of powder in 200 millilitres of water until one fourth of the liquid remains.
3. Paste for application over the wound is prepared by mixing 5 to 10 grams of turmeric powder in an equal amount of clean water.

## Dosage Form
- Yellow-coloured fine powder
- Decoction
- Paste

## Therapeutic Properties
Haridra has anti-inflammatory, blood purifying, anti-allergic, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-protozoal, demulcent, and wound-healing properties.

# Traditional Herbal Remedies for Primary Health Care



# Dose and Mode of Administration

Haridra may be used simultaneously for washing the wound, application as paste on wound, and orally in the following ways and dose schedule:

1. **Oral Use**:
- The dose of turmeric powder for adults is 2 to 5 grams and for children it is 1 to 2 grams, or juice of fresh turmeric in the dose of 10 to 20 millilitres for adults and 5 to 10 ml for children.

# Indications and Uses

1. External and internal use of turmeric is indicated in acute and chronic wounds with not much damage to the tissues.
2. Sepsis, allergic reaction, inflammation, and skin discoloration around the wound are also manageable with oral use and topical application of turmeric.

# Precautions and Safety Aspects

1. Due care must be taken to keep the wound clean and dry. It is advisable to use turmeric decoction for washing the wound.
2. Frank bleeding and pus discharge from the wound should be attended to properly.
3. Treatment with turmeric may be stopped if it does not yield beneficial effects in a couple of days.
4. Being regularly used as a food item, turmeric is considered safe and no toxic or adverse effects are reported from its long-term use. However, its oral use in children and pregnant women should be done under medical supervision. It is safe for the baby if a nursing mother is taking this medication.
5. Persons receiving aspirin and warfarin should take turmeric with caution since their combination may cause bleeding.
6. Side effects with turmeric may occur with the use of more than the recommended doses. In that case, it may cause stomach upset or other gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhoea.
